what are callback functions
           -- it is a function that is passed as an argument to another function

callback hell(pyramid of doom)
---------------------------------
   -it is a situation where we have multiple callbacks inside a callback(nested callbacks)
   -hard to read       
   -hard to maintain/modify 
   -hard to debug
   -this usually happens when we have to perform multiple asynchronous operations
   
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
promises:
+++++++++++++++
 - a promise in js is an object that represents the outcome of an asynchronous operation
 - it is used to handle the success and failure of an asynchronous operation
 - states in promises :
     1. pending-initial state
     2. fulfilled-the operation was successful
     3. rejected-the operation failed
 - we can use then() function to handle the success and failure of a promise
 - we can use catch() function to handle the failure of a promise
 - we can use finally() function to handle the success and failure of a promise
